# NASA Image of the Day, on your Desktop!
This is a short Java program that, when run, writes [NASA's image of the day](https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/iotd.html) to two image files. You can set those images to a slideshow that changes once a day. For more info, see my [instructable on this](https://www.instructables.com/id/NASA-Image-of-the-Day-As-Your-Desktop/).

To use this, I have a shortcut to the Java program in my startup folder on my Windows 10 PC, so it automatially updates the image daily.
